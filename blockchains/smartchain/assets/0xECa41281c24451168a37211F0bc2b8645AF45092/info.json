    "description": "TokenPocket is the world's largest decentralized multi-chain digital asset wallet, covering over 10 million users (including over 3 million monthly active users) in more than 200 countries and regions. 
As the only token in the TokenPocket ecology, TPT has ecological governance rights. At the same time, TPT circulates in a variety of scenarios as a means of payment and proves the benefits and rights of membership, which opens up a channel in the entire TokenPocket product line.
Currently, TPT can be used to purchase resources of multiple public blockchains, subscribe for wallet VIP membership, pay for TP advertising fee, etc. (The total supply of TPT has been reduced from 5.9 billion to 3.46 billion after the burn) In 2021, to provide users with a more efficient financial experience, TP will further integrate CeFi and DeFi, and significantly upgrade features of cross-chain aggregated transactions. That is when TPT will also be given more rights and benefits as a core token.",
